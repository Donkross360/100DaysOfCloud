# Day30 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
  Trained a Deep Learning model with AWS Deep Learning Containers (DL Containers) on Amazon EC2.


## Use Case
 - AWS Deep Learning Containers (DL Containers) are Docker images pre-installed with deep learning frameworks to make it easy to deploy custom machine learning environments quickly by letting you skip the complicated process of building and optimizing your environments from scratch.

## Cloud Research
 - Using AWS DL Containers, developers and data scientists can quickly add machine learning to their containerized applications deployed on Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS), self-managed Kubernetes, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and Amazon EC2.
