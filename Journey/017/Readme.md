# Day17 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
build my first modern application on AWS. Modern applications isolate business logic, optimize reuse and iteration, and remove overhead everywhere possible.

## Use Case
 - This tutorial will walk you through the steps to create a well-architected sample web application discussed above. You will learn to host this web application on a front-end web server and connect it to a backend database. Youâ€™ll also learn to set up user authentication and will be able to collect and analyze user behavior.

## Cloud Research
 - will be creating and deploying changes to this application completely programmatically. You will use the AWS Command Line Interface to execute commands that create the required infrastructure components, which includes a fully managed CI/CD stack utilizing AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline. Finally, you will complete the development tasks required all within your own browser using the cloud-based IDE, AWS Cloud9.
