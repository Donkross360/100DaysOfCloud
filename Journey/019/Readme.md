# Day19 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

## Use Case
 - Created an AWS Lambda function, Created an Amazon API Gateway endpoint and finally Debug API Gateway and Lambda with AWS CloudWatch.

## Cloud Research
 -The idea of a microservices architecture is to take a large, complex system and break it down into independent, decoupled services that are easy to manage and extend. This enables developers to meet their key design goals like extensibility, availability and maintainability.

 - Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda provide the perfect combination of web services to effortlessly build, deliver and maintain a suite of microservices that can be the foundation of complex software systems.
