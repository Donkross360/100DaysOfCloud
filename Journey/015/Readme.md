# Day15 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
Deploy a Kubernetes Application with Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes.

## Use Case
 - Amazon EKS is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS. Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes control plane for you across multiple AWS availability zones to eliminate a single point of failure.

## Cloud Research
 - use Amazon EKS to deploy a highly available Kubernetes control plane. You will then configure 'kubectl', an open source command line tool to interact with your Kubernetes infrastructure. Using AWS CloudFormation, you will launch a cluster of worker nodes on Amazon EC2, then launch a containerized guest book application onto your cluster.
