# Day7 Of My Severless Journey

## Introduction

I decided to give Amazon Rekognition a shot

## Prerequisite

If you are curious about ML like i am, then i guess you are up for this.

## Use Case

- A facial recognition API for various verification systems, automating video editing, comparison etc. 

## Cloud Research

- As a developer, facial recognition and comparison is a new challenge you will face if you are developing an employee verification system, need to automate video editing, or provide secondary authentication for other applications

## Try yourself

Amazon rekognition blew be away, like i feel oppressed right now and it so easy to use. kudo to all the hard working people @AWS.
