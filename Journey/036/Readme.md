# Day36 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
  Studied this WhitePaper :  Best Practices for VPCs and Networking in Amazon WorkSpaces Deployments - July 2020.


## Use Case
 - Amazon WorkSpace is a cloud-based virtual desktop that can act as a replacement for a traditional desktop.

## Cloud Research
 - Amazon WorkSpaces is a managed, secure cloud desktop service. Proper network configuration is essential to the successful implementation and ongoing operations of a WorkSpaces environment. As an End User Computing (EUC) service, any variation to the end user’s experience when interacting with a WorkSpaces instance is very visible and can result in a loss of workforce productivity—especially if network connectivity has not been designed in accordance with best practices.
