# Day24 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
 Still on AWS CloudFormation

## Use Case
 - AWS CloudFormation #InfrastructureAsCode Simply put - You define all the resources you want AWS to spin up in a blueprint(template) document, click a button, and then AWS magically creates it all.

## Cloud Research
 - So instead of having to write script with a bunch of AWS API calls, wait loops, and retry logic, you just tell describe what you want and tell CloudFormation to do it for you.
