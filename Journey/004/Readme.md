# Day4 Of My Serverless Journey

## AWS ElasticBeanStalk

- I have always wanted to migrate my currently running web app to the cloud after looking aroung a bit for solutions, i bumped into elasticbeanstalk and the journey has been fun!

## Use Case

- This is automation at its best. 

## Cloud Research

- Using Eb-cli i was able to configure and deploy a django web app to AWS, elasticBeanStalk handle everything including S3 bucket creation and EC2 instance etc. pretty much everything it was awesome.
