# Day25 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
 Still on AWS CloudFormation

## Use Case
 - After an extensive read, finally launched an AWS CloudFormatinon Stack, was able to convert a Json file to Yaml. and delete the stack all via CLI.

## Cloud Research
 - Instead of starting with an empty CloudFormation template, grab a starter template from the AWS Documentation. The simple one we want is Amazon EC2 instance in a security group. The example template provided is in json form but I prefer using yaml. So Iâ€™ve taken the example template and have converted it to yaml.
