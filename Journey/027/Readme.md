# Day27 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
 Modeling Game Player Data with Amazon DynamoDB.


## Use Case
 - Advanced data modeling patterns in Amazon DynamoDB. When using DynamoDB, it is important to consider how you will access your data (your access patterns) before you model your data.

## Cloud Research
 - DynamoDB is a popular database service for games because it is designed for high-scale use cases where consistent performance is critical as an application grows.

 - Some of the key reasons to use DynamoDB for your game are:
 - Scalability: DynamoDB scales to more than 100 TB with no performance degradation.
 - A simple REST-based API: DynamoDB is accessible over HTTP(S) and uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication.
 - Fully managed: You donâ€™t need to manage servers and apply patches to infrastructure. DynamoDB handles upgrades, backups, and other administrative tasks so that you can focus on developing your game.
