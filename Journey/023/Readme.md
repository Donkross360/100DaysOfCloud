# Day23 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
AWS CloudFormation

## Use Case
 - Declare the AWS resources you want to create and configure. You declare an object as a name-value pair or a pairing of a name with a set of child objects enclosed.

## Cloud Research
 - So instead of having to write script with a bunch of AWS API calls, wait loops, and retry logic, you just tell describe what you want and tell CloudFormation to do it for you.
