# Day37 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
  Created my first AWS CDK Python project.


## Use Case
 - The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to model and provision cloud application resources.

## Cloud Research
 - AWS CDK uses the familiarity and expressive power of programming languages for modeling your applications. It provides you with high-level components that preconfigure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation. It also enables you to compose and share your own custom components that incorporate your organization's requirements, helping you start new projects faster.
