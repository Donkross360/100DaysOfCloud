# Day21 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
Design a database for a mobile app with Amazon DynamoDB.

## Use Case
 - learned advanced data modeling patterns in Amazon DynamoDB while building a DynamoDB-backed mobile application. When using DynamoDB, it is important to consider how you will access your data (your access patterns) before you model your data.

## Cloud Research
 - Some of the key reasons to use DynamoDB for your mobile application are:
 - Scalability: DynamoDB has no performance degradation as you scale to terabytes of data and beyond.
 - A simple, REST-based API: DynamoDB is accessible over HTTP(S) and uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication.
 - Fully-managed: You donâ€™t need to manage servers and apply patches to infrastructure. DynamoDB handles upgrades, backups, and other administrative tasks so that you can focus on developing your application.
