# Day14 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
AWS Deep Learning AMI with Amazon EC2 via SSH.
## Use Case
 - Using the AMI, you can train custom models, experiment with new algorithms, and learn new deep learning skills and techniques. The AMIs come with pre-installed open source deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch, Chainer, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Caffe, Caffe2, Theano, and Keras, optimized for high performance on Amazon EC2 instances. The AMIs also offer GPU and CPU-acceleration through pre-configured drivers, and come with popular Python packages.

## Cloud Research
 - Launch EC2 instance using a Deep Learning AMI, connect to the instance via SSH, and access a Jupyter Notebook from my workstation.
