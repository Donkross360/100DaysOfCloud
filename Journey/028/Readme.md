# Day28 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
 Build a real-time leaderboard with Amazon Aurora Serverless and Amazon ElastiCache.


## Use Case
 - Deployed a leaderboard system for online puzzle game with Aurora Serverless  & the Data API for fast, elastic, fully-managed data storage, ElastiCache for fast lookups, Cognito for user authentication, Lambda for compute, API Gateway for HTTP routing.

## Cloud Research
 - Amazon Aurora Serverless and Amazon ElastiCache are both commonly used individually in game applications. You may want to use them together in your game application to get a combination of top-tier speed of an in-memory cache with the reliability and flexibility of a relational database. In this lab, you use Amazon ElastiCache to perform high-volume, low-latency leaderboard checks for different games, and you use Amazon Aurora Serverless to store all historical data and provide redundancy for the leaderboard data.
