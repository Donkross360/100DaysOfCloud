## Introduction

I have always wonder how  sending and recieving email via AWS would differ from the conventional way we are used to when you pay for hosting and all.

## Use Case

- Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) even though i was able to send some emails, its clear it can do alot for sending bulk emails and sms even push notification,but nothing about an email client UI was mentioned.  

## Cloud Research

- I was able to use SNS service to send emails but without client side UI for sending and receiving email without loging into the console?? i can't help but wonder. or perhaps i  got to do more reseach
