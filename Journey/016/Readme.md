# Day16 Of My Severles Journey

## Introduction
created a DynamoDB table and use the table to store and retrieve data.used Python and Boto 3, the AWS SDK for Python, for interacting with the DynamoDB APIs.

## Use Case
 - You should understand how to model your data to fit both your application’s data access patterns and your database’s underlying model.

## Cloud Research
 - DynamoDB provides low-latency performance with near-infinite scaling, so you do not need to worry about performance bottlenecks as your application grows. DynamoDB is accessible over an HTTP API or an HTTPS endpoint, providing a simple, secure interaction model with your database. Finally, DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, allowing for flexible schema design that can evolve with your application.
